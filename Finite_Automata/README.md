# Deterministic finite automaton | Nondeterministic finite automaton

## Finite Automata:

Are a foundational concept in the field of computer science, particularly in the areas of automata theory and formal languages. They are abstract machines capable of representing and executing algorithms for recognizing patterns within input processed from their initial state to various other states based on predefined rules.
Finite automata are crucial in designing compilers and interpreters, network protocols, and file systems. They are particularly famous for their role in implementing regular expressions (Regex).

## Projects:
- Deterministic finite automaton
- Minimization of deterministic finite automaton
- Nondeterministic finite automaton

Each of them use the finite automation on a given example.
